# Evaluating generative models for Graph-to-Text Generation

We evaluated GPT-3 and ChatGPT on two graph-to-text generation benchmarks: [AGENDA](https://github.com/rikdz/GraphWriter/tree/master/data) and [WebNLG](https://gitlab.com/shimorina/webnlg-dataset/-/tree/master/webnlg_challenge_2017/test). 

We collected the text generated by GPT-3 and ChatGPT in [data](/data).
