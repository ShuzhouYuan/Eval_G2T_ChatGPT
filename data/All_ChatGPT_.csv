2,"Thompson Sampling is a popular Bayesian algorithm for the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem that has shown impressive empirical performance. In this paper, we provide novel regret bounds for Thompson Sampling that are both prior-free and prior-dependent. The prior-free regret bound assumes a non-Bayesian stochastic bandit, making no assumption about the prior distribution. The prior-dependent regret bound, on the other hand, is derived by assuming a prior distribution on the reward distributions of the bandit problem. We also provide distribution-free and distribution-dependent bounds, offering a comprehensive analysis of the performance of Thompson Sampling. Furthermore, we show that our prior-dependent regret bound is tight for a wide range of prior distributions. Finally, we demonstrate the practical usefulness of our bounds through simulations on various bandit problem instances. Our results indicate that our proposed Thompson Sampling algorithm with prior-dependent regret bounds significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms. Overall, this paper contributes to a better understanding of the performance of Thompson Sampling in stochastic multi-armed bandit problems and provides practical guidelines for its use.",1

6,"This paper proposes a method for estimating speech recognition error rate without requiring acoustic test data. The proposed method utilizes probabilistic phoneme sequence conversion rules and phonemic confusion models that are learned from phonemic transcription pairs. The confusion models are derived from leave-one-out decoding, which involves iteratively leaving out each transcription pair and decoding the remaining pairs to obtain a probability distribution over word hypotheses. The phonemic transcription pairs are obtained from a text test corpus, which is used to evaluate the performance of the automatic speech recognition system at the phonemic level. The proposed method does not require any acoustic data, making it particularly useful for evaluating the performance of speech recognition systems that operate in noisy environments. We also investigate the impact of different factors, such as grammar design and dialog strategy, on the estimated word error rate. The results demonstrate that our method provides accurate estimates of word error rate and is able to capture important factors that affect the performance of automatic speech recognition systems.

8,"This paper proposes a novel approach to speech recognition based on the product of power spectrum and modified group delay function. Traditional speech recognition systems typically use features such as magnitude spectrum and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients to represent the speech signal. However, these features do not capture the phase spectrum of the signal, which can contain valuable information about the speech. The proposed approach addresses this limitation by incorporating the phase spectrum through the modified group delay function, which is derived from the group delay function of the signal. The modified group delay function is then combined with the power spectrum to generate cepstral features that capture both the magnitude and phase information of the signal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a speech recognition task and show that our method outperforms traditional methods based on magnitude spectrum and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. Our method offers a promising approach for speech recognition that captures both the magnitude and phase information of the speech signal, enabling more accurate recognition.",1

10,"This paper presents a novel approach for streaming three-dimensional graphic scenes in resource-constrained environments. Specifically, we propose a sender-driven mechanism called Partially Ordered Delivery (PODs) that optimizes the delivery of 3D scene data within a limited network bandwidth of 100-kb bit rate. PODs utilizes the decoding independencies of the 3D scene data to prioritize the delivery of certain parts of the scene that are required for the scene to be rendered. This approach improves the rendering quality of the scene while minimizing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the network. In addition, we propose a heuristic for selecting the parts of the scene that should be prioritized for delivery based on their importance for rendering the scene.

604,"This paper presents an analysis of the sample complexity and performance bounds for non-parametric approximate linear programming (ALP). ALP is a method for solving Markov decision processes (MDPs) with infinite action spaces by approximating the value function using a set of basis functions. In this study, the approximation architecture is based on a smoothness assumption for the value function, and the Bellman equation is used to obtain an approximate solution. The analysis considers the effect of noise on the ALP algorithm and shows that the method is robust to small amounts of noise. The sample complexity and performance bounds of the algorithm are also derived, providing theoretical guarantees for its effectiveness. The results demonstrate that non-parametric ALP can achieve good performance with a relatively small number of samples, making it a promising approach for real-world transitions where the number of possible actions is large or infinite. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of the strengths and limitations of non-parametric ALP for solving MDPs with infinite action spaces.",1

996,"This paper addresses the problem of pursuit and capture in polygonal environments with obstacles. Given a simply-connected polygon of n vertices and a set of o (log n) pursuers, the goal is to capture an evader that moves at maximum speed in a deterministic fashion. The problem is approached using a visibility-based pursuit-evasion strategy that relies on the line-of-sight detection and a discrete-time step framework. The pursuit strategy assumes that the evader has a minimum feature size property, and the search strategy is deterministic. The proposed method is evaluated in arbitrary polygonal environments, and the experimental results show that the visibility-based approach is effective in capturing the evader in various scenarios. The proposed method provides a practical solution to the pursuit and capture problem in polygonal environments with obstacles, and can be applied to various real-world scenarios, such as surveillance and security systems. Moreover, the study of the line-of-sight detection and its relationship with the number of pursuers sheds light on the fundamental aspects of the pursuit and capture problem.",1

The aim is to improve the coding efficiency of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard by reducing the average bitrate while maintaining the same video quality. The proposed Smart decoder approach focuses on exploiting the spatio-temporal redundancies present in video sequences to optimize the coding modes. It achieves this by introducing a causal reference signaling mechanism between the encoder and decoder. The Smart decoder method includes a set of coding modes that adapt to the video content, making it possible to achieve better coding efficiency. The paper evaluates the Smart decoder approach and shows that it can save an average bitrate of up to 50% compared to the HEVC standard, while maintaining similar video quality.",1
1995,"the coding efficiency of the new video coding standard , high efficiency video coding , is strongly associated with better use of spatio-temporal redundancies thanks to an increased number of competing coding modes . however , this competition involves a massive increase in signaling bitrate which becomes a possible limit for the next generation of en-coder . this paper proposes a new coding scheme that breaks with conventional approaches . coding scheme exploits a more complex decoder able to reproduce the choice of the encoder based on causal references , eliminating thus the need to signal coding modes and associated parameters . the general outline of this new coding scheme and a proposed implementation are described in this paper . experimental results under common test conditions report an average bitrate saving of 1.7 % at the same quality compared to hevc for a wide range of video sequences .",0
1996,"This paper proposes a novel approach for predicting the performance of the IDA* search algorithm using conditional distributions of heuristic values. The authors compare the performance of IDA* using static distributions of heuristic values with that of using conditional distributions, for both single-start states and random sample start states. They also examine the impact of inconsistent heuristics on the predictive accuracy of the two approaches. Results show that using conditional distributions can significantly improve the accuracy of performance prediction, particularly when the heuristic is inconsistent. This approach has the potential to enhance the efficiency of IDA* and improve its application in real-world problems.",1
1997,"-lrb- korf , reid , and edelkamp 2001 -rrb- introduced a formula to predict the number of nodes ida * will expand given the static distribution of heuristic values . their formula proved to be very accurate but it is only accurate under the following limitations : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the heuristic must be consistent ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- the prediction is for a large random sample of start states -lrb- or for large thresholds -rrb- . in this paper we generalize the static distribution to a conditional distribution of heuristic values . we then propose a new formula for predicting the performance of ida * that works well for inconsistent heuristics -lrb- zahavi et al. 2007 -rrb- and for any set of start states , not just a random sample . we also show how the formula can be enhanced to work well for single start states . experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of our method in all these situations .",0
1998,This paper proposes a novel technique for identifying multipath channel parameters using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in the cross-ambiguity domain. The PSO-based technique is compared with the traditional Array Signal Processing (ASP) technique and the Generalized Expectation Maximization (GEM) technique. The optimization problem involves determining the transmitted signal and SNR values. The results show that the PSO-based technique outperforms the other two techniques in terms of identifying channel parameters accurately. The proposed technique provides an efficient and effective solution for channel identification in wireless communication systems.,1
1999,"in this paper , a new array signal processing technique by using particle swarm optimization is proposed to identify multipath channel parameters . the proposed array signal processing technique provides estimates to the channel parameters by finding a global minimum of an optimization problem . since the optimization problem is formulated in the cross-ambiguity function -lrb- caf -rrb- domain of the transmitted signal and the received array outputs , the proposed array signal processing technique is called as particle swarm optimization . the performance of the particle swarm optimization is compared with the space alternating generalized expectation maximization technique and with another recently proposed pso based technique for various snr values . simulation results indicate the superior performance of the pso based technique over mentioned techniques for all snr values .",0
