2,"This paper presents prior-free and prior-dependent regret bounds for Thompson Sampling in the context of non-bayesian stochastic bandit problems. Specifically, the paper focuses on two regret bounds, distribution-free and distribution-dependent.

These bounds are used to evaluate the performance of Thompson Sampling in terms of recommending the best arm in a given problem.",1

66,This paper presents a reverberant speech enhancement method based on a one-microphone algorithm. The proposed method uses a pitch-based reverberation measure for estimating the reverberation time to distinguish between reverberant and non-reverberant speech in real-time. This measure is computed by considering relative time lags between the reverberation effects on different harmonic structures and relative strengths of each pitch component. The algorithm also takes into account echo components and other reverberation features to improve the speech enhancement performance. Evaluation results show that the proposed reverberant speech enhancement method outperforms other existing methods in terms of reverberation time estimation and overall speech enhancement performance.,1
